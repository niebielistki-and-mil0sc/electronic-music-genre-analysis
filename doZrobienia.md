1. Temporal Dynamic Features
* For Tempo Variability, you can divide the song into segments and calculate the tempo for each segment using librosa.beat.tempo for variability analysis.
2. Rhythmic Patterns
* Investigating rhythmic patterns might require extracting beat information with librosa.beat.beat_track and analyzing the beat intervals or using machine learning models to classify rhythmic patterns.
3. Instrumentation and Orchestration
* Using a pre-trained deep learning model that recognizes instruments in audio clips can be helpful. Open-source projects or datasets like NSynth or tools like Essentia provide functionalities that could assist in instrument recognition.
4. Mood and Affect Features
* Audio features related to mood, such as spectral features or MFCCs, can be extracted with Librosa. For sentiment analysis on lyrics, you might use NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy, along with sentiment analysis models available in Hugging Face's Transformers library.
5. Harmony and Tonality
* Chord recognition and key detection can be done with libraries like music21 or using deep learning models designed for music analysis. Librosa provides some harmonic features, but detailed harmonic analysis might require custom approaches or additional libraries.
6. Form and Structure
* Music structure analysis can be complex, involving segmentation and classification of sections. Techniques might include self-similarity matrices and clustering, available in Librosa, or using specialized models for music structure analysis.
7. Lyrics Analysis
* If you have access to lyrics, NLP techniques can analyze textual content. For lyrics extraction, APIs like Genius API can be used. For processing, Python libraries such as NLTK or spaCy can help in extracting themes or performing sentiment analysis.
8. User Data and Metadata
	•	Incorporating user data or metadata involves collecting this information from databases or APIs (like Spotify Web API for playlists, tags, and artist metadata). Analysis could range from simple statistics to complex machine learning models that find patterns in this data.
