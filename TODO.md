# Advanced Music Genre Classification Program

## 1. User Uploads a Piece of Music

### Frontend (Django Templates + HTML + JavaScript):

- Create a simple, intuitive user interface for file uploads. This should include an HTML form in yourDjango template, utilizing the `<input type="file">` element for music file selection.
- Implement JavaScript to enhance the user experience, such as immediate upload feedback or a loading animation while the file is being processed.

### Backend (Django Views + Forms):

- In your Django app, define a form in forms.py to handle music file uploads, ensuring you validate the file type and size to prevent malicious uploads.
- Write a view in views.py to handle the POST request from the form, saving the uploaded file to a temporary location or directly passing it to your analysis pipeline.
- Ensure security best practices are followed, including validation of file types and handling errors gracefully.

## 2. Program Analyzes the Music Genre

### Refined Action Plan:

**1. Project Setup:**

- Ensure your project's goals and scope are clearly defined, focusing on genre classification accuracy and user experience.
- Setup your Python environment with necessary libraries (Django, Librosa, TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn) and ensure your development tools (e.g., PyCharm, virtual environments) are properly configured.

**2. Data Collection:**

- Broaden your dataset sources beyond Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music to include diverse genres from platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud, or music databases.
- Aim for a balanced dataset that represents a wide array of musical genres and subgenres to improve classification accuracy.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**

- Standardize audio file formats (e.g., WAV or MP3) to ensure consistency in analysis.
- Slice music into short, manageable segments to focus on key features of each genre, utilizing tools like Librosa for efficient processing.

- 
**4. Feature Extraction:**

- Extract a comprehensive set of features using Librosa, focusing on spectral features (spectral centroid, bandwidth, contrast), rhythm features (tempo, beat), and texture features (MFCCs).
- Consider additional features that may capture genre-specific characteristics, such as harmonic and percussive elements.

**5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Use visualizations (e.g., seaborn or matplotlib in Python) to explore feature distributions and identify patterns that may distinguish genres.
- Investigate correlations between features and genres to refine your feature set for optimal classification performance.

**6. Model Selection and Training:**

- Explore various machine learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks for deep learning, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) to find the best fit for your genre classification task.
- Utilize a combination of training, validation, and test sets for model training and hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.

**7. Evaluation:**

- Apply rigorous evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to assess model performance on unseen test data.
- Conduct error analysis to understand misclassifications and refine your model accordingly.

**8. Project Iteration:**

- Iteratively refine your model based on evaluation feedback, experimenting with different models, features, and data preprocessing techniques to enhance classification accuracy.


## 3. Displaying the Analysis Result to the User
### Frontend Display:

- Design a results page in Django templates to display the genre classification results. Use dynamic elements (e.g., percentage bars created with CSS or JavaScript libraries) to show the genre distribution.
- Include a brief description of the detected genre(s) by pulling information from a predefined dataset or an API that provides music genre descriptions.
- Display a list of representative artists for the detected genre(s), including photos. Ensure you have the right to use the artists' images, possibly using public APIs from music services that provide such information.

### Backend Logic:

- After the genre classification, the backend should aggregate additional information for each identified genre, including a brief description and a list of representative artists with photos. This could be stored in your Django model or fetched from external APIs.
- The view responsible for displaying the results should query your database or external APIs for this additional information based on the classification results and pass it to the template for rendering.

### Integration and Testing:

- Ensure that the entire flow from upload to results display is seamless and test with a variety of music tracks to cover as many genres as possible.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the interface and the accuracy of genre classification, making adjustments as necessary to improve both usability and performance.
